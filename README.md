# GFX Framework

## :sparkles: Introduction

This project is a tiny graphics framework used by the Computer Graphics Department of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.
It is currently used as teaching and study material for a number of courses of increasing complexity, including, but not limited to:

-   **`EGC`** Elements of Computer Graphics, BSc year 3 &mdash; [course materials (RO)](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/egc)
-   **`SPG`** Graphics Processing Systems, BSc year 4 &mdash; [course materials (RO)](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/spg)

The project contains my implementation of the laboratories and homework assignments for the EGC course.
